FB|It's happening again. Facebook (FB -7%) dives in early trading to $31.65 - shares are now down 17% from their $38 IPO price, though the company's multiples are still high.

MSFT|Contributing to today's drop in LinkedIn (LNKD -5.3%) is a cautious note from ITG, which thinks the company's pricing and volume have dipped in Q2.

TSLA|Shares of Tesla Motors (NASDAQ:TSLA) take another leg down, now off 6.6% premarket, on a harsh downgrade from Wunderlich.

Search ad prices will be in focus, following two quarters of significant declines.

GOOG|Unlike Microsoft, Google (GOOG +3.1%) is holding onto its post-earnings gains. The Street is taking heart in strong Y/Y paid click growth and a halt to recent ad price declines.

FB|Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) is now only down 1.7% AH in response to its Q4 beat, which followed a 50%+ rally over the last 3 months. Zynga (NASDAQ:ZNGA) is up 1.6% - the fact Facebook's Payments revenue rose 8% Q/Q (but was flat Y/Y) after adjusting for an accounting quirk is going over well. In its Q4 slide deck (.pdf), Facebook notes its global ARPU rose 19% Q/Q and 12% Y/Y to $1.54. ARPU for the U.S./Canada ($4.08) is still well above ARPUs for Europe ($1.71), Asia ($0.69), and the rest of the world ($0.56). U.S./Canada made up 49% of Q4 sales vs. 50% in Q3.

Though expecting SolarCity to hit its 2013 deployment target of 250MW, Needham now sees less upside. On the earnings call, SolarCity mentioned it's talking with ratings agencies to lower financing costs for installations - the company recently refinanced some early debt to 3.45% from a prior 8%. Even after accounting for financing funds, SolarCity expects to burn cash over the next 3 quarters before again turning net cash flow positive.
