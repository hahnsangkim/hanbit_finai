The company sees $1B in annual run rate cost synergies within three years of closing.</li>\n<li>Terms: Time Warner owners will receive $107.50 per share comprised of $53.75 of cash and $53.75 in AT&amp;T stock. A collar is involved, meaning TWX shareholders get 1.437 shares of AT&amp;T should its average stock price be below $37.411 at closing, and 1.3 shares of AT&amp;T should it be above $41.349 (Friday's close for T was $37.49, and for TWX $89.48).</li>\n<li>The cash portion of the deal will be funded with cash and new debt. By the end of year one after closing, AT&amp;T expects net debt to adjusted EBITDA to be in the 2.5x range.</li>\n<li>Speaking <a href=\"http://www.wsj.com/articles/at-t-reaches-deal-to-buy-time-warner-for-more-than-80-billion-1477157084\" target=\"_blank\">on a conference call last night</a>, Stephenson played down any regulatory concerns with the argument that AT&amp;T isn't eliminating a competitor, but rather is buying a supplier - the sort of merger typically not blocked by D.C.</li>\n<li>Alongside the merger announcement, AT&amp;T also reported its Q3, with adjusted EPS of $0.74 missing estimates by a penny.
