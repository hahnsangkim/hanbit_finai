Insurers often require druggists to switch to the generic, causing Valeant to lose the sale. To get around this, Valeant has been distributing coupons that allow patients to lower or even avoid a co-pay if they ordered the drugs through Philidor.</li>\n<li>Reitz stopped sending Philidor the millions of dollars in checks that he was receiving from insurers for prescription shipments, in order to protect himself from \"massive potential\" liability. On Sept. 4, VRX sent a letter to Reitz, demanding $69M it said the small-town pharmacist owed.</li>\n<li>Source: <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-1101-valeant-pharmacy-20151101-story.html\" target=\"_blank\">LA Times</a>\n</li> </ul><div class=\"tiny-share-widget\" data-id=\"2880446\" data-linked=\"Pharmacist at center of scandal accuses Valeant of &quot;massive fraud&quot;\" data-tweet=\"$BHC - Pharmacist at center of scandal accuses Valeant of &quot;massive fraud&quot; https://seekingalpha.com/news/2880446-pharmacist-center-of-scandal-accuses-valeant-of-massive-fraud?source=tweet\" data-url=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/2880446-pharmacist-center-of-scandal-accuses-valeant-of-massive-fraud\"><div class=\"icon share-btn c-email\" title=\"Email a friend\">&nbsp;</div><div class=\"icon share-btn c-twitter\" title=\"Share on Twitter\">&nbsp;</div><div class=\"icon share-btn c-facebook\" title=\"Share on Facebook\">&nbsp;</div><div class=\"icon share-btn c-linkedin\" title=\"Share on Linkedin\">&nbsp;</div></div><span class=\"mc_gray_separator\">|</span> 12:10 PM <span class='mc_gray_separator'>|</span> <span class='comments-n'><span class='comments-container '>169&nbsp;<span class='comments-number'>Comments</span></span></span></div></div></li>","count":1,"message":null,"success":true,"today":{"start":1576990800,"end":1577077199,"str":"Sunday, December 22, 2019"},"yesterday":{"start":1576904400,"end":1576990799}}
