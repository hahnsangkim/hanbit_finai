We believe the building blocks of this performance can already be seen. A complicated accounting set-up and reporting changes that impede earnings have refocused investor attention on cash flow... we think cash flow can improve substantially.</li>   <li>Rolls-Royce generated &pound;100 mn of company-defined FCF in 2016, and has guided to stable performance in 2017. Therefore the current equity value (&pound;13 bn) already reflects a degree of cash flow improvement. We value the company on EV/DACF (debt adjusted cash flow), on 2018 estimates, equating to a 12-month price target of 1030p. We use a multiple of 11.4x, derived from a returns-based valuation screen. On a more simplistic screen our price target implies 8% FCFe yield and 14x P/E in 2020E; if we were to incorporate the additional FX benefit, which we believe should come through in 2021-23E, these would change to 12% and 9.3x, respectively.</li>   <li><a href=\"https://image.webservices.ft.com/v1/images/raw/%2F%2Fwww.ft.com%2F__origami%2Fservice%2Fimage%2Fv2%2Fimages%2Fraw%2Fhttp%253A%252F%252Fi.imgur.com%252FctPnyws.png%3Fsource%3DAlphaville%26width%3D675%26fit%3Dscale-down\" target=\"_blank\">Here is the six-chart summary &raquo;</a></li> </ul><div class=\"tiny-share-widget\" data-id=\"3244603\" data-linked=\"Rolls-Royce jumps as Goldman plugs stock\" data-tweet=\"$RYCEF $RYCEF $RYCEY - Rolls-Royce jumps as Goldman plugs stock https://seekingalpha.com/news/3244603-rolls-royce-jumps-goldman-plugs-stock?source=tweet\" data-url=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/3244603-rolls-royce-jumps-goldman-plugs-stock\"><div class=\"icon share-btn c-email\" title=\"Email a friend\">&nbsp;</div><div class=\"icon share-btn c-twitter\" title=\"Share on Twitter\">&nbsp;</div><div class=\"icon share-btn c-facebook\" title=\"Share on Facebook\">&nbsp;</div><div class=\"icon share-btn c-linkedin\" title=\"Share on Linkedin\">&nbsp;</div></div><span class=\"mc_gray_separator\">|</span>  1:23 PM </div></div></li><li class=\"n-box-item sa-box-item\" data-id=\"3244602\" data-ts=\"1487614240\"><div class=\"media media-overflow-fix\"><div class=\"media-left\"><a class=\"box-ticker\" href=\"/symbol/UN\" target=\"_blank\">UN</a></div><div class=\"media-body\"><h4 class=\"media-heading\"><a href=\"/news/3244602-unilever-what-next\" sasource=\"on_the_move_news_fidelity\" target=\"_blank\">Unilever: So what next?</a></h4><ul>   <li>Credit Suisse comments on Kraft Heinz's <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/3244574-kraft-pulls-143b-unilever-offer\" target=\"_blank\">backing away</a> from its $143B bid for Unilever (<a href=\"https://ftalphaville.ft.com/marketslive/2017-02-20/\" target=\"_blank\">via FT</a>):</li>   <li>So what next? Unilever has been given a sharp wakeup call that it cannot disregard. Its reluctance to engage with Kraft Heinz is understandable, but will it now feel it needs to offer something else to its shareholders?</li>   <li>At the very least the prospect of KHC taking its leverage to over 6x Ebitda begs the question: is Unilever making best use of its balance sheet on behalf of investors? Moving to 3x Ebitda would allow Unilever to do a &euro;20 billion share buy-back or a &euro;7 per share special dividend (17% yield). The former would be double digit accretive, the latter only c7% dilutive.</li>   <li>Or might this encourage Unilever to be more aggressive on M&amp;A? Whilst KHC appears to have (irrevocably?) walked away, it is clear that investors are willing to back big deals.</li>   <li>What this approach does tell us is that KHC&rsquo;s appetite is far from satiated, and size is no obstacle at all to their ambitions. Their presence will likely continue to loom heavily over all industry participants.</li>   <li>We expect Unilever to respond to this episode by releasing some value to shareholders (some of whom no doubt are disappointed that the prospect of a control premium evaporated so soon after it first appeared).</li><li>Unilever fell <font color='red'>5.1%</font> today in Amsterdam.</li> </ul><div class=\"tiny-share-widget\" data-id=\"3244602\" data-linked=\"Unilever: So what next?\" data-tweet=\"$UN $UN $UL - Unilever: So what next? https://seekingalpha.com/news/3244602-unilever-what-next?source=tweet\" data-url=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/3244602-unilever-what-next\"><div class=\"icon share-btn c-email\" title=\"Email a friend\">&nbsp;</div><div class=\"icon share-btn c-twitter\" title=\"Share on Twitter\">&nbsp;</div><div class=\"icon share-btn c-facebook\" title=\"Share on Facebook\">&nbsp;</div><div class=\"icon share-btn c-linkedin\" title=\"Share on Linkedin\">&nbsp;</div></div><span class=\"mc_gray_separator\">|</span>  1:10 PM <span class='mc_gray_separator'>|</span> <span class='comments-n'><span class='comments-container '>35&nbsp;<span class='comments-number'>Comments</span></span></span></div></div></li><li class=\"n-box-item sa-box-item\" data-id=\"3244601\" data-ts=\"1487613758\"><div class=\"media media-overflow-fix\"><div class=\"media-left\"><a class=\"box-ticker\" href=\"/symbol/PSO\" target=\"_blank\">PSO</a></div><div class=\"media-body\"><h4 class=\"media-heading\"><a href=\"/news/3244601-pearsonminus-3_9-on-strong-comments-from-berenberg\" sasource=\"on_the_move_news_fidelity\" target=\"_blank\">Pearson -3.9% on strong comments from Berenberg</a></h4><ul>   <li>Shares of Pearson (NYSE:<a href='https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/PSO' title='Pearson plc'>PSO</a>) fell <font color='red'>3.9%</font> today in London after Berenberg (Sell) dropped its price target to 400p, implying <font color='red'>38%</font> downside.</li>   <li>Key points from the note, <a href=\"https://ftalphaville.ft.com/marketslive/2017-02-20/\" target=\"_blank\">via FT</a>:</li>   <li>Pearson has a major problem: In fiscal 2015, higher education courseware contributed 40-45% of group EBIT. This key division faces serious structural and cyclical issues, which will continue until industry profits have normalised at much lower levels. We do not see a short-term fix.</li>   <li>Leverage is higher than assumed: With returns likely to have impacted 2016 year-end cash flows, and the new strategy affecting cash flow in future, leverage is higher than the market thinks. We note recent negative statements by both Moody&rsquo;s and S&amp;P. Thus, Pearson is unlikely to return any cash to shareholders following a sale or recapitalisation of PRH.</li>   <li>Is there opportunity for more cost savings? Pearson has already spent &pound;610m on two restructurings in the last five years, yielding cumulative savings of &pound;586m, before cumulative reinvestment of &pound;100m and normal cost inflation. We do not see further opportunities for major savings, other than via cuts that would negatively impact the core business, such as reducing the size of the salesforce.</li>   <li>We do not see industry consolidation as likely: Pearson is market leader (with a c40% share) in US higher education courseware, an industry that is already highly consolidated; we therefore do not see anti-trust authorities approving further concentration, which might have generated meaningful synergies in the event of a deal. The K-12 courseware and testing markets are also oligopolies, again suggesting anti-trust issues.</li>   <li>What about private equity? With no easy cost savings, relatively high leverage, and no potential to sell a cleaned up Pearson to a competitor, we think private equity will steer clear. Anyone buying Pearson must have a clear view of how to fix higher education, and how to do it quickly. Private equity is hardly getting rich quick on the back of this industry - see McGraw-Hill and Cengage results - which won&rsquo;t encourage new investors.</li>   <li>Could a breakup work? The problem is that so much of group profit is declining. This is not a case of cutting off a diseased limb: it is a diseased body. If Pearson sold its attractive assets - Connections Education and Embanet, for example - it would be even more reliant on the declining higher education asset. Conversely, a sale of that unit looks very unlikely.</li> </ul><div class=\"tiny-share-widget\" data-id=\"3244601\" data-linked=\"Pearson -3.9% on strong comments from Berenberg\" data-tweet=\"$PSO - Pearson -3.9% on strong comments from Berenberg https://seekingalpha.com/news/3244601-pearsonminus-3_9-on-strong-comments-from-berenberg?source=tweet\" data-url=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/3244601-pearsonminus-3_9-on-strong-comments-from-berenberg\"><div class=\"icon share-btn c-email\" title=\"Email a friend\">&nbsp;</div><div class=\"icon share-btn c-twitter\" title=\"Share on Twitter\">&nbsp;</div><div class=\"icon share-btn c-facebook\" title=\"Share on Facebook\">&nbsp;</div><div class=\"icon share-btn c-linkedin\" title=\"Share on Linkedin\">&nbsp;</div></div><span class=\"mc_gray_separator\">|</span>  1:02 PM <span class='mc_gray_separator'>|</span> <span class='comments-n'><span class='comments-container '>1&nbsp;<span class='comments-number'>Comment</span></span></span></div></div></li><li class=\"n-box-item sa-box-item\" data-id=\"3244597\" data-ts=\"1487608212\"><div class=\"media media-overflow-fix\"><div class=\"media-left\"><a class=\"box-ticker\" href=\"/symbol/JD\" target=\"_blank\">JD</a></div><div class=\"media-body\"><h4 class=\"media-heading\"><a href=\"/news/3244597-jd-com-under-investigation-for-legal-breach-bloomberg\" sasource=\"on_the_move_news_fidelity\" target=\"_blank\">JD.com under investigation for a legal breach - Bloomberg</a></h4><ul>     <li>Chinese regulators have begun investigating JD.com's (NASDAQ:<a href='https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/JD' title='JD.com'>JD</a>) finance affiliate over allegations it breached securities laws, claiming it underwrote unapproved securities via its \"Bai Na\" service, Bloomberg reported on Friday.
