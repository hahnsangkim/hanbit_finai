    "## Prerequisites\n",
    "### To understand\n",
    "* **Python** – you don't need to be an expert python programmer, but you do need to know the basics. If you don't, the official [Python tutorial](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/) is a good place to start.\n",
    "* **Scientific Python** – We will be using a few popular python libraries, in particular NumPy, matplotlib and pandas. If you are not familiar with these libraries, you should probably start by going through the tutorials in the Tools section (especially NumPy).\n",
    "\n",
    "### To run the examples\n",
    "* **Jupyter** – These notebooks are based on Jupyter. If you just plan to read without running any code, there's really nothing more to know, just keep reading!    "
